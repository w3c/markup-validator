      Mistakes that can cause this error include:

    <ul>
      <li>putting text directly in the body of the document without wrapping 
      it in a container element (such as a &lt;p&gt;aragraph&lt;/p&gt;), or</li>
      <li>forgetting to quote an attribute value
      (where characters such as "%" and "/" are common, but cannot appear
      without surrounding quotes), or</li>
      <li>using XHTML-style self-closing tags (such as &lt;meta ... /&gt;)
          in HTML 4.01 or earlier. To fix, remove the extra slash ('/')
          character. For more information about the reasons for this, see

    <p>
      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.
      This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a
      "style" element in the "body" section instead of inside "head" -- or
      two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML
      documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error
      can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's "self-closing"
      tags for "meta" and "link" in the "head" section of a HTML document may
      cause the parser to infer the end of the "head" section and the
      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not
      allowed; hence the reported error).

      The mentioned element is not allowed to appear in the context in which
      you've placed it; the other mentioned elements are the only ones that
      are both allowed there <em>and</em> can contain the element mentioned.
      This might mean that you need a containing element, or possibly that
      you've forgotten to close a previous element.
    </p>
    <p> 
      One possible cause for this message is that you have attempted to put a
      block-level element (such as "&lt;p&gt;" or "&lt;table&gt;") inside an
      inline element (such as "&lt;a&gt;", "&lt;span&gt;", or "&lt;font&gt;").

    <p>
      Most likely, you nested tags and closed them in the wrong order. For 
      example &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; is not acceptable, as &lt;em&gt;
      must be closed before &lt;p&gt;. Acceptable nesting is: 
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
    </p>
    <p>
      Another possibility is that you used an element which requires
      a child element that you did not include. Hence the parent element
      is "not finished", not complete. For instance, in HTML the &lt;head&gt;
      element must contain a &lt;title&gt; child element, lists require
      appropriate list items (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; require &lt;li&gt;;
      &lt;dl&gt; requires &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;), and so on.

    </p>

      <li>incorrect use of the "Strict" document type with a document that 
      uses frames (e.g. you must use the "Frameset" document type to get

    <p>
      The Validator found an end tag for the above element, but that element is
      not currently open. This is often caused by a leftover end tag from an
      element that was removed during editing, or by an implicitly closed
      element (if you have an error related to an element being used where it
      is not allowed, this is almost certainly the case). In the latter case
      this error will disappear as soon as you fix the original problem.

    <p>
      You have used a character that is not considered a "name character" in an
      attribute value. Which characters are considered "name characters" varies
      between the different document types, but a good rule of thumb is that
      unless the value contains <em>only</em> lower or upper case letters in the
      range a-z you must put quotation marks around the value. In fact, unless
      you have <em>extreme</em> file size requirements it is a very very good
      idea to <em>always</em> put quote marks around your attribute values. It
      is never wrong to do so, and very often it is absolutely necessary.

      An attribute name (and some attribute values) must start with one of
      a restricted set of characters. This error usually indicates that
        you have failed to add a closing quotation mark on a previous
        attribute value (so the attribute value looks like the start of a
        new attribute) or have used an attribute that is not defined

    <p>"VI delimiter" is a technical term for the equal sign. This error message 
    means that the name of an attribute and the equal sign cannot be omitted 
    when specifying an attribute. A common cause for this error message is 
    the use of "Attribute Minimization" in document types where it is not allowed, 
    in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.5">XHTML</a> for instance.</p>
    <p>How to fix: For attributes such as compact, checked or selected, do not write
    e.g &lt;option selected ... but rather &lt;option selected="selected" ...

    <p>
      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).
    </p>
    <p>
      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in
      the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no
      supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error
      message for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to fix: check the spelling and case of the element and attribute, 
      (Remember XHTML is all lower-case) and/or 
      check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or
      use CSS instead of this attribute. If you received this error when using the

      For the current document, the validator interprets strings like
      <code class="inline">&lt;FOO /&gt;</code> according to legacy rules that
      break the expectations of most authors and thus cause confusing warnings
      and error messages from the validator. This interpretation is triggered
      by HTML 4 documents or other SGML-based HTML documents. To avoid the
      messages, simply remove the "/" character in such contexts. NB: If you
      expect <code class="inline">&lt;FOO /&gt;</code> to be interpreted as an
      XML-compatible "self-closing" tag, then you need to use XHTML or HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      This warning and related errors may also be caused by an unquoted
      attribute value containing one or more "/". Example:
      <code class="inline">&lt;a href=http://w3c.org&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
      In such cases, the solution is to put quotation marks around the value.

      An entity reference was found in the document, but there is no reference
      by that name defined. Often this is caused by misspelling the reference
      name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon (;).
      <strong>The most common cause of this error is unencoded ampersands in
      URLs</strong> as described by the <a

    </p>
    <p>
      Entity references start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a
      semicolon (;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document
      you must encode it as "&amp;amp;" (<em>even inside URLs!</em>). Be
      careful to end entity references with a semicolon or your entity
      reference may get interpreted in connection with the following text.
      Also keep in mind that named entity references are case-sensitive;
      &amp;Aelig; and &amp;aelig; are different characters.

      This error may occur when there is a mistake in how a self-closing tag is closed, e.g '.../ &gt;'.
      The proper syntax is '... /&gt;' (note the position of the space).

      You've included a character reference to a character that is not defined
      in the document type you've chosen. This is most commonly caused by
      numerical references to characters from vendor proprietary
      character repertoires. Often the culprit will be fancy or typographical
      quote marks from either the Windows or Macintosh character repertoires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is to reference UNICODE characters instead. A list of
      common characters from the Windows character repertoire and their
      UNICODE equivalents can be found in the document "<a
