    <p id="skip">
      The W3C Markup Validation Service consists of an SGML Parser, an SGML
      catalog, a CGI program and it's configuration files. In addition it
      relies on a moderately large set of Perl modules for it's operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document tries to draw a road map of the prerequisites and what the
      different parts of the system do. It is intended for system
      administrators and people interested in helping developing the validator.
      This is not end user documentation. See the
      <a href="users.html">User Manual</a> for usage instructions.

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from a properly configured web server, the Validator needs a
        SGML parser -- that does all the hard work -- and several Perl
        modules used by the "check" CGI script.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SGML parser we're currently using is <code>OpenSP 1.5</code>,
        which can be found on the
        <a href="http://openjade.sourceforge.net/">OpenJade home page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The canonical list of Perl modules we use can be found in the source
        for the "check" CGI script. There is a bunch of lines that of the form
        "use Foo::Bar" where each "Foo::Bar" represents a module. Most modules
        can be found on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> (minimum
        versions in parenthesis after the name). The following
        list was complete when CVS spit out:

      <h2>Configuration Files</h2>
      <p>
        The validator uses a number of configuration files -- most of which
        are really mapping tables of some form -- to avoid having to check in
        a new version of the code every time a new version of HTML comes out.
        All configuration files can be found in
        <code>$CVSROOT/validator/htdocs/config/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To really understand what each does you should read the source, but
        here is a short description to get you started.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>eref.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Contains the mappings from element names to an URI fragment
          (relative to a configurable URI) for their definitions. Used
          in output when the "Show Source Input" option is enabled.
        </dd>
        <dt>fpis.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Maps FPIs to plain text version strings.
        </dd>
        <dt>frag.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Maps error messages to an URI fragment identifier where an
          explanation of that error can be found.
        </dd>
        <dt>type.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Maps MIME/HTTP Content-Types to an internal "document type" which
          is used for treating HTML, XML, and XHTML in different ways.
        </dd>
        <dt>validator.conf</dt>
        <dd>
          Main configuration file. Gives various parameters (such as the
          address of the maintainer and the URL for the "Home Page") and
          the locations of the other configuration files and mapping tables.

    <div id="todo" class="stb">
      <h2>TODO</h2>
      <p>
        The TODO list for the Validator is online at
        &lt;<a href="../todo.html">http://validator.w3.org/todo.html</a>&gt;.
 	      This is probably the best place to start.
 	    </p>
      <p>
        However this list is by no means comprehensive. Feel free to suggest
        other features that should be on this list or send patches for your
        favourite feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that features should be of general utility and that the
        point if the validator is that it does an <em>objective</em>
        validation instead of just what some random developer happens to
        think is a Good Idea&reg;. While extra features are nice, they
        shouldn't dilute the value of the validator as an objective check.
