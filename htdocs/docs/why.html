      <h2>Why Validate?</h2>
      <p>
        This document attempts to answer the questions many people have
        regarding <em>why</em> they should bother with Validating their
        web sites and tries to dispell a few common myths.

        The original version was written by
        <a href="http://www.webthing.com/~nick/">Nick Kew</a> of
        <a href="http://www.webthing.com/">Web&#222;hing Ltd.</a> for their
        <a href="http://valet.webthing.com/">Site Valet</a> service and he has
        generously donated it for our use. This version has been slightly
        modified, but is essentially the same.

      <h3>What is Validation?</h3>
      <p>
        Validation is a process of checking your documents against a formal
        Standard, such as those published by the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>
        for HTML and XML-derived Web document types, or by the
        <a href="http://www.wapforum.org/">WapForum</a> for WML, etc.  It
        serves a similar purpose to spellchecking and proofreading for grammar
        and syntax, but is much more precise and reliable than any of those
        processes because it is dealing with precisely-specified machine
        languages, not with nebulously-defined human natural language.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that validation has a very precise meaning.
        Unfortunately the issue is confused by the fact that some products
        falsely claim to "validate", whilst in fact applying an arbitrary
        selection of tests that are not derived from any standard.  Such 
        tools may be genuinely useful, but should be used alongside true
        validation, not in place of it.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>Why Validate?</h3>
      <p>
        Well, firstly there is the very practical issue that non-valid
        pages are (by definition) relying on error-correction by a
        browser.  This error correction can and does vary radically
        across different browsers and versions, so that many authors
        who unwittingly relied on the quirks of Netscape 1.1 suddenly
        found their pages appeared totally blank in Netscape 2.0.
        Whilst Internet Explorer initially set out to be bug-compatible
        with Netscape, it too has moved towards standards compliance in
        later releases.  Other browsers differ further.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three questions below deal with three different points of
        view on the issue of Validation.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>The novice (or non-technical website owner) question:</dt>
        <dd>
          <h4>"My site looks right and works fine - isn't that enough?"</h4>
          <p>
            The answer to this one is that markup languages are no more than
            data formats.  So a website doesn't look like anything at all!
            It only takes on a visual appearance when it is presented by
            your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, different browsers can and do display the same page
            very differently.  This is deliberate, and doesn't imply any kind
            of browser bug.  A term sometimes used for this is WYSINWOG -
            What You See Is Not What Others Get (unless by coincidence).
            It is indeed one of the principal strengths of the web, that
            (for example) a visually impaired user can select very large print
            or text-to-speech without a publisher having to go to the
            trouble and expense of preparing a separate edition.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is perhaps unfortunate that the best-known browsers - Netscape
            Navigator and MS Internet Explorer on Windows - are visually very
            similar indeed in their presentation of many documents, differing
            only in trivial details like margins and spacings.  The "same"
            browser on a Mac or Unix/Linux display will often look far more
            different.
          </p>

        <dt>The perceptive observation</dt>
        <dd>
          <h4>"Lots of websites out there don't validate -
            including household-name companies."</h4>
          <p>
            Do remember: household-name companies expect people to visit 
            <em>because of</em> the name and <em>in spite of</em>
            dreadful websites.  Can <em>you</em> afford that luxury?
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you can, do you want to risk being on the wrong side of a
            lawsuit if your site proves inaccessible to - for instance - a
            disabled person who cannot use a 'conventional' browser?
            Accessibility is the law in many countries.  Whilst validation
            doesn't guarantee accessibility (there is no substitute for common
            sense), it should be an important component of exercising "due
            diligence".  It is now just over a year since a court first
            awarded damages to a blind user against the owners
            of a website he found inaccessible (Maguire vs SOCOG, August 2000).

        <dt>The strawman argument</dt>
        <dd>
          <h4>"Validation means boring websites, and stifles creativity"</h4>
          <p>
            This is simply head-in-the-sand ignorance (indeed, it lies at the
            heart of the most spectacular hype-filled dot-com failures).
            Validation is fully compatible with a wide range of dynamic pages,
            multimedia presentations, scripting and active content, etc.  It
            is part of the difference between doing it right and doing it
            wrong in a dynamic multimedia presentation, just as much as in a
            purely textual site.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is perfectly in order for authors to express their creativity on
            the Web, though it is of course generally more approriate to some
            sites (e.g. recreational ones) than to others (e.g. informational
            or functional sites like this one). But authors with creative
            ambitions should bear in mind that in any artistic field, you
            <em>must</em> start with a thorough understanding
            of the rules before breaking them.  Otherwise you just look
            foolish.
