      You have used character data somewhere it is not permitted to appear.
      Mistakes that can cause this error include putting text directly in the
      body of the document without wrapping it in a container element (such as
      a &lt;p&gt;aragraph&lt;/p&gt;) or forgetting to quote an attribute value
      (where characters such as "%" and "/" are common, but cannot appear

      The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed.
      This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a
      "style" element in the "body" section instead of inside "head" -- or
      two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML
      documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error
      can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's "self-closing"
      tags for "meta" and "link" in the "head" section of a HTML document may
      cause the parser to infer the end of the "head" section and the
      beginning of the "body" section (where "link" and "meta" are not
      allowed; hence the reported error).

      One possible cause for this message is that you have attempted to put a

      Another possibility is that you used an element (e.g. 'ul') which requires

      The Validator found an end tag for the above element, but that element is
      not currently open. This is often caused by a leftover end tag from an
      element that was removed during editing, or by an implicitly closed
      element (if you have an error related to an element being used where it
      is not allowed, this is almost certainly the case). In the latter case
      this error will disappear as soon as you fix the original problem.

      You have used a character that is not considered a "name character" in an
      attribute value. Which characters are considered "name characters" varies
      between the different document types, but a good rule of thumb is that
      unless the value contains <em>only</em> lower or upper case letters in the
      range a-z you must put quotation marks around the value. In fact, unless
      you have <em>extreme</em> file size requirements it is a very very good
      idea to <em>always</em> put quote marks around your attribute values. It
      is never wrong to do so, and very often it is absolutely necessary.

      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the

      An entity reference was found in the document, but there is no reference
      by that name defined. Often this is caused by misspelling the reference
      name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon (;).
      <strong>The most common cause of this error is unencoded ampersands in
      URLs</strong> as described by the <a
        href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/">WDG</a> in "<a
        href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp">Ampersands
        in URLs</a>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Entity references start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a
      semicolon (;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document
      you must encode it as "&amp;amp;" (<em>even inside URLs!</em>). Be
      careful to end entity references with a semicolon or your entity
      reference may get interpreted in connection with the following text.
      Also keep in mind that named entity references are case-sensitive;
      &amp;Aelig; and &amp;aelig; are different characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in most documents, errors related to entity references will
      trigger up to 5 separate messages from the Validator. Usually these
      will all disappear when the original problem is fixed.

      You've included a character reference to a character that is not defined
      in the document type you've chosen. This is most commonly caused by
      numerical references to characters from vendor proprietary
      character repertoires. Often the culprit will be fancy or typographical
      quote marks from either the Windows or Macintosh character repertoires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is to reference UNICODE characters instead. A list of
      common characters from the Windows character repertoire and their
      UNICODE equivalents can be found in the document "<a
        href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www/windows-chars.html#list"
